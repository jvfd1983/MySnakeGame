# My Snake Game


### Introduction:
The objective of the game is simple: control the Snake (with the Arrow Keys) as it moves around the grass, aiming to eat the Apples that appear randomly on the screen.
The Snake grows longer, making the game progressively more challenging.

Things to avoid:

Collition with the **walls** of the playing Area;<br>
Collition with your **self** (tail).
